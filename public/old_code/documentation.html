        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Your project aims to create an interactive platform designed to
          enhance writing skills, specifically targeted at learners of Swedish.
          It includes structured writing tasks, vocabulary building exercises,
          and grammatical lessons, all intended to aid Swedish language
          acquisition in an engaging and educational format.

        <h2>Achievements So Far</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML Structure Creation:</strong> Developed the primary HTML
            structure for the web pages, which includes navigation, content
            sections, and footers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Implemented a cohesive design schema
            using CSS that provides a visually appealing and user-friendly
            interface. Styles such as the step-boxes for different tasks ensure
            that each section is visually distinct and engaging.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Development:</strong> Focused on two main tasks; the
            first task engages users to contribute to community development with
            suggestions, and the second task revolves around narrating a
            memorable travel experience. Both tasks are designed to stimulate
            thoughtful writing and reflection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive Elements:</strong> Added functionality for
            interactivity, such as navigation links and buttons, to facilitate
            user engagement and navigation across different sections of the
            platform.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Content Expansion:</strong> Plan to expand the number of
            writing tasks and include more diverse scenarios to cater to various
            aspects of daily life and interests, enhancing the platform's
            applicability to real-world situations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> Integrate an automated or
            manual feedback system where users can submit their writing tasks
            and receive constructive feedback to help them improve their writing
            skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Testing:</strong> Conduct user testing sessions to
            gather feedback on usability, effectiveness, and user engagement,
            which will guide further refinements and feature additions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility Improvements:</strong> Continue to improve
            accessibility features, ensuring the website is usable for people
            with different abilities and supports multiple devices and screen
            sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multilingual Support:</strong> Although currently focused on
            Swedish, plans to incorporate other languages will broaden the
            platform's reach and utility.
          </li>

        <h2>Reuse in Future Conversations</h2>
        <p>
          This summary encapsulates the core elements and future directions of
          the project. It can be used to quickly bring new collaborators up to
